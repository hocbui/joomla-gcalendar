Hello

This package contains the google calendar simplepie extension 
also called simplepie-gcalendar.

In this package is simplepie 1.2.0 used, but simplepie-gcalendar
should run with all simplepie 1.0 versions.

In the src folder is the source simplepie-gcalendar.php. Use this
as library together with simplepie to have an addon for google 
calendar feeds.

In the demo folder is a small demonstration source to get an impression
how to use the simplepie google calendar extension. Just put the demo
folder on a web server and open the address of the index.php file with
a web browser.

The newest releases can be downloaded at

Have fun!!

Hello

This package contains the google analytics simplepie extension 
also called simplepie-ganalytics.

In this package is simplepie 1.2.0 used, but simplepie-ganalytics
should run with all simplepie 1.0 versions.

In the src folder is the source simplepie-ganalytics.php. Use this
as library together with simplepie to have an addon for google 
analytics feeds.

In the demo folder is a small demonstration source to get an impression
how to use the simplepie google analytics extension. Just put the demo
folder on a web server and open the address of the index.php file with
a web browser.

The newest releases can be downloaded at

Have fun!!
